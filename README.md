This web application is a modern take on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Players can play against each other by marking cells on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O). The objective is to be the first to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game features dynamic updates to the user interface, immediate detection of win or draw conditions, and a restart button to play again.
